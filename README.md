## Skills

#### Problem-Solving

During university, in my third year research project i was tasked with finding a potential treatment for Urinary tract infections (UTI'S). And through my rigorous research i was able to come up with a theoretical solution, which demonstrated my ability to solve a complex problem thorough persistance and creative thinking.


#### Teamwork

Having been played rugby in a semi-professional environment i have been able to quickly build good relations with all of my fellow teammates. I establish my role within a team very quickly and try to give my teammates clear and consise insturctions and feedback. My time playing rugby has also generated my competitive spirit, so whatever team/organsiation i find myself in, i wish to help make us better than the competitors.
