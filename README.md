## Josh Steadman
I'm a junior developer and a biochemistry graduate from the University of Southampton. I have a professional approach to work and study and I am eager to develop my skills and career. Strong performer as part of a team and on my own as demonstrated in my approach to my semi-professional sporting journey. I'm seeking a career as a developer as I have always been truly intrigued by how different types of applications can be created, and i believe thereâ€™s real power in being able to build something from scratch using code. Having now scratched the surface of how web/mobile applications can be developed i have been well and truly sucked in to the trials and tribulations of a developer, as well as the sweet satisfaction of your code running successfully! And i wish to continue this on in my career!

## Skills

#### Problem-Solving

During university, in my third year research project i was tasked with finding a potential treatment for Urinary tract infections (UTI'S). And through my rigorous research i was able to come up with a theoretical solution that involved restricting the bacteria's source of food so that it could no longer replicate, which demonstrated my ability to solve a complex problem thorough persistance and creative thinking. I also enjoy attempting the challenging code kata's on codewars and i have managed to work my way up to rank 5 kyo as i attempt more challenging kata's


#### Teamwork

Having been played rugby in a semi-professional environment i have been able to quickly build good relations with all of my fellow teammates. I establish my role within a team very quickly and try to give my teammates clear and consise insturctions and feedback. My time playing rugby has also generated my competitive spirit, which drives me to be better and deliver my tasks to the utmost of my ability for the sake of the team/organisation that i am a part of.
